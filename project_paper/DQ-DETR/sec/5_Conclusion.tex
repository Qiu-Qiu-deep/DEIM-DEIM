\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\hspace{\parindent}In this paper, we analyze that the fixed number and position of queries in previous DETR-like methods are unsuitable for detecting tiny objects in aerial datasets and propose a new end-to-end transformer detector DQ-DETR with a categorical counting module, counting-guided feature enhancement, and dynamic query selection.
Our DQ-DETR dynamically adjusts the number of object queries used for detection to solve the imbalance of instances between different aerial images.
Also, we improve the positional information of queries, making it easier for the decoder to localize the tiny object.
DQ-DETR is the first DETR-like model focusing on tiny object detection and achieves 30.2\% $\mathrm{AP}$, which is the state-of-the-art of AI-TOD-V2.
The result shows that our proposed DQ-DETR improves the performance of detecting tiny objects, outperforming all previous CNN-based detectors and DETR-like methods on the AI-TOD-V2 dataset with ResNet50 as the backbone.
