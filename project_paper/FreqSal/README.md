- In this project, we proposed the deep Fourier-embedded network, namely FreqSal, a purely Fourier-based model aimed at solving the high-resolution bimodal inputs and feature fusion while minimizing memory consumption of GPU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art bimodal salient object detection (SOD) models on four RGB-T, five RGB-D, and one RGB-D-T SOD benchmark datasets. **To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Fourier-based supervised model in a series of SOD tasks.**
